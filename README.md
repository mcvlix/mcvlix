## 🔬 Current Research: Cognitive Cryptography & The Rosario-Wang Proof

I am researching **stateless, holographic proofs of human identity**. My work focuses on the **Rosario-Wang Proof (RWP)** system, a new cryptographic primitive that treats human memory and neural dynamics not as data to be stored, but as a **bounded dynamical system** that generates unique, unforgeable interaction traces.

We spend a lot of time in the ENI6MA lab, very close to some of San Francisco's major tech buildinbgs.

*   **🔭 Focus Areas:** Epistemic Incompleteness, Information-Theoretic Safety, Robot Correctness.
*   **🧠 Key Concept:** Identity is not a *credential* you hold; it is an *interaction* you perform.

## 🎓 PhD Aspirations

I am pursuing a PhD in **Computational & Mathematical Engineering** to formalize the mathematics of human identity.

*   **Stateless Proofs:** Moving beyond PKI/Passwords to dynamic, interactive verification.
*   **Holographic Errors:** Using coding theory (Erasure Codes, List Decoding) to recover "true" identity from noisy cognitive projections.
*   **Generative Limits:** Defining the information-theoretic bounds where generative AI *cannot* perfectly mimic human stochasticity.

## 🛠️ Technical Arsenal

*   **Simulation:** `PyTorch`, `CUDA`, `NumPy`, `SciPy` (GPU-accelerated SDE solvers, Lorenz 96 systems).
*   **HPC:** `OpenMP`, `MPI` (🥈 2nd Place, Winter Classic Invitational Student Cluster Competition).
*   **Math:** Numerical PDE Solvers, Dynamical Systems, Stochastic Calculus, Information Theory.
